<article style=""><h1>Origin Story</h1><p>The history of Claym</p></article>

Claym began as a thought experiment in 2012\. At the time I had been working on a design document for a videogame that featured golems as a central component, and I asked the question "What would chess look like in a world where golems were commonplace?"

Chess is heavily informed by the martial traditions of India (where it originated) and Europe, but those traditions in a world with golems would be vastly different.

The central idea was that everything was ultimately made of clay (hence the name) and thus ultimately mutable. The fact that the pieces were all fundamentally made of the same material played into the central mechanic of the game: **every piece "promotes" in the exact same way, regardless of its rank** (because the pieces are in some sense all the same).

In order to pay homage to the chess inspiration, I needed to differentiate the pieces, too. So while every piece has identical rules for promotion, they all have different movement and strategic purpose.
